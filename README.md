# QuickTouch OS

QuickTouch OS gives you faster access to everything, including performance!

- Fresh Interface - Best in performance - Allows customization.
- And you know what? we even support Non-ROM Exist devices (like if your device doesnt have any custom rom.)

## QuickTouch GSI

Type your device name into the search engine and add "custom ROM" to the end. No results? Thanks to us, now there are.
QuickTouch GSI allows you to experience QuickTouchOS with Generic System Images. even with dsu loader!
But you need to know that some features would be not available.

# What's different Between QuickTouch and QuickTouch GSI?
- Customization Options.
- Stabilation and Performance
- Updates.

Like The regular version will get Android 17, but if you use QT GSI. it would be out later than the regular one.
You have boot animation options in regular version but not in GSI version.
Basically it is a lite version of QuickTouch OS.
